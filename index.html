  <p> These questions are designed to cover bits of knowledge in preparation for the UK neurology SCE exam. I have tried not to include questions to which I already know the answer to concentrate on missing bits of my knowledge. They therefore reflect my own areas of weakness (eg peripheral nerve and stroke).</p></p>

  <p>There are no marks. Just type an answer, then press the button to see if you're correct. Refreshing the page will remove all your current answers so you can start again.</p>

  <p>This website is entirely written by me, partly as an exercise in HTML5. At some point I'll have a bash at a form to submit questions. The code is at <a href=https://github.com/rittman/neurologySCE.git target="github">my github page</a>. Please feel free to visit and contribute.</p>

  <p>Select sections from the list on the left.</p>
